Feature: User registration form
    In order to allow users to create an account on a site
    As a site owner
    I want to expose a user registration form

Scenario: Registration is disabled for users who do not have the "user/register" policy
    Given I do not have the user/register policy
     When I go to "/register"
     Then I see an error message saying that I can not register

Scenario: A new user account can be registered from "/register"
    Given I do have the user/register policy
      And I go to "/register"
     Then I can see the registration form
      And it matches the structure of the configured registration user Content Type
      And it has a register button
     When I fill in the form with valid values
      And I click on the register button
     Then I am on the registration confirmation page
      And I see a registration confirmation message
      And the user account has been created

Scenario: The user group where registered users are created can be customized
    Given a User Group
      And the following configuration:
      """
      ezpublish:
        system:
          default:
            users:
              registration_group_id: <userGroupContentId>
      """
     When I register a user account
     Then the user is created in this user group
